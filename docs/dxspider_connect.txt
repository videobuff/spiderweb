how to connect dx-spider to another cluster node:
- login on gnu/linux as sysop user
- go in spider/connect folder and create a file named OTHERCALLSIGN with the connection info of the other node
- from your client (IU1BOW) send command: set/spider OHTERCALLSIGN
- Open file /spider/local_cmd/crontab ed put  0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * start_connect('OTHERCALLSIGN') unless connected('OTHERCALLSIGN')
